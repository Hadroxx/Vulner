## ‚ú® Features

- üîç Kernel info, system version, architecture
- üìÅ World-writable and SUID file enumeration
- üîë Cron job checks and PATH hijack detection
- üêö User, password, shadow, and sudo analysis
- üì¶ Package listings and vulnerable versions
- üõ† Local exploit suggestion (optional manual input or tool linking)
